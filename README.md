Hello

I'm Johan, an Agricultural Scientist from Cape Town South Africa. Growing up on a farm in rural South Africa, I quickly realized my love for the nature and farming. I ended up studying Agricultural Sciences at Stellenbosch University, graduating with a Masters degree in 2019. Besides my love for farming and the outdoors, I have always been curious about computers and the ever increasing role they play in our every day lives.

At the moment I am enjoying learning as much as I can about the applications of software tools in the Agricultural space. Agriculture and specifically farming is an age old industry, but the adoption of software tools have lagged consistently behind other industries. I believe multiple factors influence this slow adoption of software tools: 1) users (farmers) are not well informed as to the ways in which sofware tools can help them. This might be due to the abstract nature of software tools or maybe that developers have not yet adapted their products to properly fit the users needs (product market fit). Futhermore, many farms are located in rural areas where internet connections are limited or are interupted by intermittend disconnections (offline). Current applications that are available in the market are not built from the ground up to have strong offline capable features or be offline-frist centric.

This brings me back to this Hello_World respository, my first GitHub project. I learned that GitHub is an exceptional tool to share and collaborate on any software projects. I'm looking forward to using GitHub as a tool to explore small personal projects and hopefully in the future collaborate on bigger projects with other individuals.

Cheers!

Johan Stephan
