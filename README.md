# hello_world

My original repository.

Hello, I'm Johan a agriculturist from South Africa. Born and raised on a farm, it was no accident that I ended up studying in the natural sciences. Although my passion for nature and farming still remains to this day, I couldnt help but notice the interesting things happening in the technology space. My curiosity has led me to explore topics far beyond my comfort zone, such as the object oriented programming, data manipulation, statistical programming etc data science, object oriented programming and machine learning. Reading about these topics where great, but at some point I felt the need to jump in and start to learn hands on.

This brings me back to this Hello_World respository, my first GitHub project. I learned that GitHub is an exceptional tool to share and collaborate on any software project.
Cheers!
